###About/Usage
Uber Ride Call is an app that is used to alert the user that their Uber has arrived. It uses the phone's system time to alert the 
user when they should be expecting their Uber to arrive. To set an alert, choose the "Create New Ride Notification" button and 
set the appropriate time. After setting the time, press "Done" and the notification will be added to the queue. Once the time comes
for your Uber to arrive, the system will alert the user and display the date and time of the Uber's arrival.
